# Bouncing Ball

**Physical calculations with bouncing ball**
<br/>
A ball is dropped from a height of $h = 30\text{ m}$ and a weight of $m = 1\text{ kg}$. Every time the ball hits the ground, $\frac{1}{4}$ of its mechanical energy goes to friction (ie $E_i = \tfrac{3}{4}E_{i-1}$ during its ith movement.
