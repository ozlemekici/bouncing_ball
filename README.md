# Bouncing Ball

**Physical calculations with bouncing ball**
<br/>
A ball is dropped from a height of h = 30 m and a weight of m = 1 kg. Every time the ball hits the ground, 1/4 of its mechanical energy goes to friction (ie E_i = 3/4E_(i-1)) during its ith movement.

Jupyter Notebook and Python files are available.
